# table-visualization

To run the app in localhost, you need to:
- Run npm install in frontend and backend folders.
- Add the database file to the backend/db folder. (The database file is too large to push to github.)
- Run npm start in the frontend folder.
- Run nodemon index.js in the backend folder.
